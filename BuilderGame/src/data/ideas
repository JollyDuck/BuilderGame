Cabbage silos - store cabbages, because town centre has a limited amount of space for such things.
Buildings to upgrade minion abilities such as speed - gyms? Can only upgrade a set amount of minions,
 so need more than one for big civs
Houses to house the minions, can be upgraded to house more minions per tile
Watchtowers to alert enemy aproach (if manned), but leaves the player the choice of hiding the minions or keep harvesting
Forests are a thing - limited resource (or maybe the grow back over time?) and need to be in your influence
Banks to secure a set amount of resources, everything else can be taken (if not protected)
Minion to build roads on pheramone-high concentration routes
